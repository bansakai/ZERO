### Before you Start:

1. Ensure your Official Tarkov is installed and **up-to-date!**
2. Install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z2409-x64.exe) if you haven't already.

### Installation:

1. Download the `Main Files` from Discord under **#Downloads.**
2. Download the Installer from [here.](https://syncade.gg/spt)
3. Open `Installer.exe` and follow the instructions.
4. Once complete, navigate to where you just installed SPT.
5. **Delete all files** except for `EscapeFromTarkov_Data` folder, and `EscapeFromTarkov.exe.` You should be left with the following:<br><br><img src="https://gitfront.io/r/bansakai/em1m9ZL7VfDC/ZERO/raw/Resources/Remains.png" width="500" /><br><br>
6. Now, open `ZEROMOD.7z` using 7-Zip and move all included files in place of the ones you deleted. It should look similar to the structure below:<br><br><img src="https://gitfront.io/r/bansakai/em1m9ZL7VfDC/ZERO/raw/Resources/Structure.png" width="500" /><br><br>
7. Start `Launch EFT ZERO`
8. From here, ensure you've downloaded and installed the Latest Update. The updater will redirect you if needed.
9. Enter your Discord name exactly how it is written in the Syncade server, then click `Register`
10. If you get a message saying `User Doesn't Exist...` you entered the wrong name. If so, click `No` and ping me on Discord for your login.
11. Once you're logged in, click the Settings icon, then `Clear Cache` at the top.
12. In Settings under `Game Path` choose the SPT folder where you installed everything.
13. Now click the arrow in the top right to save.
14. Click `Start Game`
